# Shortest-Path-Finder
In this assignment, you are working on a program that searches for a path from the houses of CS students to Middlesex College so they can study. There are various map files and each map includes one student's house as the starting point and Middlesex College as the destination. The students have limited energy (10, by default) so the program must omit paths that are too long. Walking from one cell to the next results in the student losing 1 energy, so they can walk up to 10 cells before they get too weary. However, the students can eat donuts to re-gain 3 energy as they walk so that their journey can be longer before they get tired. In the current time, we have to be careful to avoid COVID-19 while out in public places. Some of these maps contain one or more Covid cells which are dangerous and must be completely avoided. The students cannot go within 1 space of those cells or else they will risk contracting the virus. This program should omit any paths in which the students steps onto a cell that is orthogonally adjacent to a Covid cell.
